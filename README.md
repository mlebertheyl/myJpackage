# myJpackage

`myJpackage` is a collection of functions that will produce a code as output. It is the opposite of what we usually expect from an `R` function, where the output is a manipulation of the data in some way. Here, there are no data results, but actually a longer code. However, this is the code you can pass to your JAGS model. Also, the arguments for the functions have to do with the type of model you want to specify in JAGS.
