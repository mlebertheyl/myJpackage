Description: `myJpackage` is a collection of functions that will produce a code as output. 
    It is the opposite of what we usually expect from an `R` function, where the output is a manipulation of the 
    data in some way. Here, there are no data results, but actually a longer code. 
    However, this is the code you can pass to your JAGS model. Make sure you have JAGS installed on your computer, as it is an outside software
    Also, the arguments for the functions have to do with the type of model you want to specify in JAGS.
    If you want to run the output code generated by this package, make sure you have JAGS installed on your computer, as it is an outside software. 
    Use `jags_init` if you need help with JAGS installation.
